Mirul MAKER Portfolio
Welcome to the official repository for Mirul MAKER! This is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase various experimental projects, ranging from hardware engineering (Raspberry Pi, ESP32) to web development and street photography.

🚀 Key Features
Apple-Inspired Aesthetics: Features a clean, modern design utilizing "iCloud style" glassmorphism, blur effects, and Apple's system typography.

Dynamic Dual-Theme: Supports a high-contrast AMOLED Dark Mode and a soft iCloud-style Light Mode. User preferences are saved via localStorage to persist across sessions.

Interactive Liquid Buttons: Custom-built navigation and call-to-action buttons featuring a unique "liquid fill" animation on hover.

Project Progress Tracking: Integrated progress bars for each project to visualize completion status (e.g., Raspberry Pi 5 Desktop at 90%).

Advanced Scroll Animations: Uses the Intersection Observer API to trigger fade-in effects for project cards and skill bars as the user scrolls.

Specialized Project Sub-pages: Includes dedicated landing pages like the RPi4 Cyberdeck, which features a distinct Matrix-inspired cyberpunk aesthetic.

🛠️ Technology Stack
HTML5: Structured semantic markup.

CSS3: Advanced styling using CSS Variables, Flexbox, Grid Layout, and Keyframe animations for a fluid UI.

JavaScript (Vanilla): Custom logic for theme toggling, smooth scrolling, and scroll-triggered animations without external libraries.

📂 File Structure
index.html: The main landing page containing the introduction, portfolio grid, and skills section.

raspberry_pi_cyberdeck.html: A specialized showcase page for the Cyberdeck project.

style.css: The primary stylesheet managing the glassmorphism UI and responsive design.

cyberpunk.css: An alternative stylesheet for the Cyberdeck page featuring glitch and glow effects.

script.js: The engine behind theme switching, progress bar animations, and scroll observers.

🌟 Featured Projects
Raspberry Pi4 Cyberdeck: A portable custom-built computer with a futuristic aesthetic.

Raspberry Pi Zero 2W Server: A low-power mini-server implementation.

ESP32 CCTV: A compact WiFi-connected monitoring system.

Cyberpunk Runner: A 2D "endless runner" game developed with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

Smart Dustbin: An IoT-based automated waste management system using Arduino Uno.
